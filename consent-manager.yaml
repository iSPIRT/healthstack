      description: >
        Result of patient care-context link request from HIP end. This happens in context of previous discovery of patient found at HIP end, therefore the link requests ought to be in reference to the patient reference and care-context references previously returned by the HIP. The correlation of discovery and link request is maintained through the transactionId. HIP should have
          1. **Validated transactionId in the request to check whether there was a discovery done previously, and the link request corresponds to returned patient care care context references**
          2. **Before returning the response, HIP should have sent an authentication request to the patient(eg: OTP verification)**
          3. **HIP should communicate the mode of authentication of a successful request**
          4. **HIP subsequently should expect the token passed via /link/confirm against the link.referenceNumber passed in this call**
          
        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:
          1. **Patient reference number is invalid**
          2. **Care context reference numbers are invalid**

      description: >
        This API is called by HIPs to confirm authentication of users. The transactionId   retuned by the previous callback API /users/auth/on-init has to sent. If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.token** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for AADHAAR demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is AADHAAR_DEMO. In case of AADHAAR demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in AADHAAR registration.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates.
