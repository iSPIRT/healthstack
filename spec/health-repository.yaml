      summary: Discover patient's accounts
      description: >
        Request for patient care context discover, made by Gateway intended for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts
          1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**
          2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**
          3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**
          4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**
          5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**
          6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**
          7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**
          8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transactionId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**

        **NOTE**: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as **dataPushUrl** in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Data Bridge and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway. 
          1. This API should be implemented at HIU side. It maybe implemented by the Data Bridge representing the HIU. 
          2. Entry elements maybe ***content*** or ***link***, although for version 1, entry ***content*** is preferred. 
          3. Entry ***content*** (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Diffie Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. 
          4. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is "application/fhir+json"
          5. checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption

      summary: Response to user authentication initialization from HIP
      description: >
        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the request is valid, then 'auth.mode' will convey how the authentication should be done. The authentication can be mediated or direct. For example, if the auth.modeis DIRECT, then HIP/HIU is not expected to send over anything as part of /auth/confirm, rather way for CM to notify them when patient approves so. For other mediated authentication modes, HIP or HIU is epected to send over eiter codes (OTP or similar) or demographic info as part of the /users/auth/confirm request accompanied with the transactionId. Note, for DIRECT authentication, CM will subsequently call /users/auth/notify call (Not spec'd yet)
        
          1. **auth.mode** conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP/HIU in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. Possible values, MOBILE_OTP - for OTP sent to mobile,  AADHAAR_OTP - if an OTP was sent as part of Aadhaar authentication. DEMOGRAPHICS - If it is expected that the HIP/HIU sends over demographi details in the /auth/confirm API call. 
          2. **meta.expiry** conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session
          3. **NOTE**, only one of **X-HIP-ID** or **X-HIU-ID** will be sent as part of header, not both. 
          
        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:
          1. **Patient id is invalid**
