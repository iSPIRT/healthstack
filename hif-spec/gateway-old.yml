    Gateway is the hub that routes/orchestrates the interaction between consent managers and API bridges. There are 5 categories of APIs; discovery, link, consent flow, data flow and  monitoring. To reflect the consumers of APIs, the above apis are also categorized under cm facing, hiu facing and hip facing

      summary: Discover patient's accounts
      description: >
        Request for patient care context discover, made by CM for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts
          1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**
          2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**
          3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**
          4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**
          5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**
          6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**
          7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**
          8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transactionId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**

        Callback API for acknowledgement of Health information request of HIU. CM calls this API when it has validated the Health Information request given the consent id. Either the **hiRequest** or **error** would need to be specified. If the health info request was valid, then the ***hiRequest.transactionId*** specifies the transaction context against which HIP would send over the data. 
        Possible cases of errors are
          1. **Invalid consent artefact id**
          2. **Consent has expired**

      summary: Response to user authentication initialization from HIP
      description: >
        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the requested 'patient.id' is valid, then 'authInit.authtype' will convey if the authentication is MEDIATED or DIRECT. If MEDIATED then it is expected that HIP sends the required token (OTP) or demographic info as part of the /users/auth/confirm request accompanied with the token. If DIRECT, then a CM will subsequently call a /users/auth/notify call (Not spec'd yet)
        
          1. **authType - MEDIATED or DIRECT**
          2. **'meta.mode' conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. If MEDIATED, the possible values, MOBILE - for OTP sent to mobile, AADHAAR_DEMO - for Aadhaar demographic auth, AADHAAR_OTP - if an OTP was sent as part of Aadhaar authentication.**
          3. **'meta.expiry' conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session**
          4. **token - the temporary token to be used for subsequent /users/auth/confirm call** 
          
        The error section in the body, represents the potential errors that may have occurred. Possible reasons:

If Authentication is successful the callback API will send an "access token" for subsequent purpose specific API calls. Note only **credential.token** or **credential.demographic** should be sent
          1. demographic details are only required for AADHAAR demographic auth as of now. 
          2. demographic details are required only in MEDIATED cases and if the **auth.mode** so demands. e.g. if **auth.mode** is AADHAAR_DEMO. In case of AADHAAR demographic authentication, the name, gender and DOB must be exactly as specified in AADHAAR registration.
          3. demographic.identifier is optional, however maybe required if authentication so mandates.
