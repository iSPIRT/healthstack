      summary: Discover patient's accounts
      description: >
        Request for patient care context discover, made by Gateway intended for a specific HIP. It is expected that HIP will subsequently return either zero or one patient record with (potentially masked) associated care contexts
          1. **At least one of the verified identifier matches**
          2. **Name (fuzzy), gender matches**
          3. **If YoB was given, age band(+-2) matches**
          4. **If unverified identifiers were given, one of them matches**
          5. **If more than one patient records would be found after aforementioned steps, then patient who matches most verified and unverified identifiers would be returned.**
          6. **If there would be still more than one patients (after ranking) error would be returned**
          7. **Intended HIP should be able to resolve and identify results returned in the subsequent link confirmation request via the specified transactionId**
          8. **Intended HIP should store the discovery results with transactionId and care contexts discovered for subsequent link initiation**

        **NOTE**: This API is actually the callback URL that is passed as **dataPushUrl** in the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. This API is directly called by HIP Health Repository and is not mediated via CM, and hence not routed through the Gateway. 
          1. This API should be implemented at HIU side. It may be implemented by the Health Respository representing the HIU. 
          2. Entry elements maybe ***content*** or ***link***, although for version 1, entry ***content*** is preferred. 
          3. Entry ***content*** (or even link reference content) must be encrypted by means of Diffie Hellman Key Exchange, utilizing the HIU keymaterials that are passed through the data request API - /v0.5/health-information/hip/request. 
          4. Media contains the mimetype of content, and for v1, it is "application/fhir+json"
          5. checksum is Md5 checksum of the data conent, before encryption
          6. Please refer to the ProjectEKA WIKI for the format of FHIR bundle that is passed through content

      summary: Response to user authentication initialization from HIP
      description: >
        If the patient's id is valid, CM will return a transactionId as initialization of user auth. If the requested 'patient.id' is valid, then 'authInit.authtype' will convey if the authentication is MEDIATED or DIRECT. If MEDIATED then it is expected that HIP sends the required token (OTP) or demographic info as part of the /users/auth/confirm request accompanied with the token. If DIRECT, then a CM will subsequently call a /users/auth/notify call (Not spec'd yet)
        
          1. **authType - MEDIATED or DIRECT**
          2. **'meta.mode' conveys whats the mode of authentication is, and what is expected from HIP in the subsequent /auth/confirm API call. If MEDIATED, the possible values, MOBILE - for OTP sent to mobile, AADHAAR_DEMO - for Aadhaar demographic auth, AADHAAR_OTP - if an OTP was sent as part of Aadhaar authentication.**
          3. **'meta.expiry' conveys the expiry time of the token and the authentication session**
          4. **token - the temporary token to be used for subsequent /users/auth/confirm call**
